## Code Overview
Firmware is written in C++ and manages:
- I2C communication with display drivers
- GPIO input from buttons
- Wi-Fi data fetching
- State switching between display modes

## üìö Notes
I designed and built this project as a personal challenge to deepen my embedded systems skills. Though no schematics are available, the board and code were developed from scratch, and photos illustrate the final product.
